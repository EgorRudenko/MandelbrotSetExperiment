It is my project for music which I did because I didn't want to sing. I have written it in linux so I have no clue whether it will run on windows or even any other machine than mine.
It divides mandelbrot set approximation into few pieces along the Y axis (like a deck of very thick 9 cards) and plays each freqency loudly or quiet dependent on a number of pixels which are part of the set it plays one pixel on x axis at a time (I think a long one, but it still sounds smooth)
